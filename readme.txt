This game is just the beta version and was programmed using python3. To change the song used in the game, just 
replace the song in music folder with your favourite one (only .mp3) and name it as '1'. If you want to run the 
program on your own, I'll be providing the source code for that. You just need to make sure you have python 3 
installed on your system and pygame module with it.

You can download python 3 from official python site and to install pygame module just run this command on cmd :
					*******	pip install pygame ******

And if you are bored during this lockdown you can read story of Lucifer Blaze that i have been writing these days. XD
Here's the link to the word ducument of the story.
